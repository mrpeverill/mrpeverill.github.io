<h3>About the Design</h3>

<p>My poster was designed based on the #betterposter layout by Mike Morrison, with some liberties taken to fit in some big central figures. For the methodology of the design, as well as a very validating analysis of where traditional poster sessions go astray, I recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RwJbhkCA58&feature=youtu.be">Mike's video about poster design</a>. My poster was built using a <a href="https://github.com/rafaelbailo/betterposter-latex-template">LaTeX template by Rafael Bailo</a>, which I would recommend highly but only if you already use LaTeX. <a href="https://osf.io/8ajqs/">Powerpoint and indesign templates</a> (including examples and helpful tips), are also available.
