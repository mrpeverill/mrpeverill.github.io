The School Social Environment Study was my dissertation study. I investigated a number of potential cognitive and social mediators of an SES psychopathology link in a sample of high schoolers. More information can be obtained in [my published dissertation](https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/handle/1773/48103) or in one of our two pre-registrations: [registration 1](https://osf.io/4urtq/), [registration 2](https://osf.io/vun9p/).
